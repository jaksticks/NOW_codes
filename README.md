# NOW_codes

Data and Jupyter notebooks for the paper "Computational methods to detect patterns of evolution in fossil occurrence data".

We have run the experiment with two different spatial resolutions, one using a 100 km and on a 500 km radius around a given geographic focal point. The data and notebooks are in folders radius100 and radius500, respectively. Both folders consist of five sub-folders: csv, figures, geopandas, notebooks and NOW_rawdata. The folder csv contains a number of csv-files that were generated as part of the analysis. The folder figures contains all the figures generated. The folder geopandas contains a number of files used to create geographic maps. The folder notebooks contain all the Jupyter notebooks that essentially form the whole data processing and analysis pipeline. The folder NOW_rawdata contains the original fossil occurrence data downloaded on 26.4.2020.

The Jupyter notebooks found in the notebooks folder are in numerical order such that running them in order recreates all of our results.
